<h1> How I Met Your Mother: Five Things That Make No Sense About Barney</h1>
    <main>
    <p>BARNEY MARRYING ROBIN IN THE FIRST PLACE  : Marriage just isn’t for some people, and that’s okay.
       Not everybody is meant to get married. Robin and Barney getting together and committing to one 
       another made some sense, despite how messy it was. After all, Cobie Smulders and Neil Patrick Harris
       do share some incredible chemistry, so the writers were smart to take advantage of it.</p>
       
    <p>THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE SLAPS : The eight slaps is another bit of HIMYM comedy that could only be
       entertaining to long-time fans of the sitcom. It’s the kind of dumb but funny thing that friends
       do, and it encapsulates both HIMYM’s warmth and good humour.</p>

    <p>THE DUCKY TIE RETURNS : Barney’s blue-tie adorned with yellow duck is a famous object on HIMYM,
       despite the fact that Barney wore it for a time with great reluctance. Beyond making Barney
       look adorably goofy, the tie represented the rare bit of a karmic payback that Barney was
       forced to endure.The tie was initially Marshall's and was the target of Barney’s relentless mockery.
       After losing a bet against Marshall and Lily, Barney, much to his chagrin, was forced to
       wear the tie for a period of time. While the show’s commitment to this gag was impressive,
       there are a few instances during which the tie disappears and reappears without explanation.</p>

    <p>HE DESTRUCTION & REAPPEARANCE OF THE PLAYBOOK : Actions speak louder than words, right?
       When Barney burned the playbook in front of Robin, he wordlessly promised to leave behind
       his manipulative and promiscuous ways, which meant that he was ready for a life of
       commitment and honesty. Despit the fact that he got Robin there with the most
       manipulative play marred the whole thing, it was undoubtedly a huge gesture for Barney.
       was significant, heralding the end of an era.Yet, the playbook appears again in
       How I Met Your Mother, only to be destroyed by Ted’s last girlfriend before Tracy,
       Jeanette -- crazy, scary Jeanette. This is the classic case of a show going back
       to its previous emotional well, only this time the well was bone dry.
       Burning the playbook should have only been done once, and it was done well the first time.</p>
       
    <p>BARNEY’S BIRTH DATE : The fact that there’s only a handful of continuity errors when it
       comes to Barney means that the writers and showrunners of How I Met Your Mother did a
       pretty good job of keeping the facts straight, especially with a sitcom as unusually
       heavy with character details as HIMY.Nevertheless, though, it must be pointed out
       that Barney’s true birth date is contradicted several times on the show. Ted mentions
       that Barney was born “seven years” after the moon landing, which means that Barney
       would have been born in 1976. However, before this, it was was mentioned that he
       was born in 1975. Though the margin of error is only a one-year difference, this
       is a pretty glaring error if you’re a rabid HIMYM aficionado.</p>
